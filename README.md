################

Droid One is a simple machine learning programm.
You'll have to teach him what are the right words to use when someone will ask him something.

Before using it, you have to download the dependencies (specified in the dependencies.txt file) to make it work.

To exit Droid-One's chat you'll have to type : exit, goodbye or bye.

If you enter the Learning Mode you have to say speak to exit it.

For the moment, i didn't setup the loop (so you'll have to start it everytime you want to speak with it :/)
